            Counseling and Psychological Services is open from 8:00am to 5:00pm, Monday through Friday, excluding weekends and University determined holidays. Our last appointments are at 4:00pm. 
            <br><br>
            A portion of the available appointments are reserved for same-day/crisis visits. A clinician will determine your level of need and will therefore determine whether we see you immediately or schedule you during the next available appointment time.
            <br><br>
            Assistance is also available after hours. Counseling & Psychological Services has partnered with ProtoCall, Inc to provide after hours emergency clinical services. ProtoCall, Inc. provides 24-hour Intake and Assessment, Crisis Response and Triage Services to the UC Merced Campus Community. ProtoCallâ€™s services enable students to speak directly with a counselor in a timely fashion, who is able to provide immediate support regarding a variety of issues, from academic and environmental stressors, mental health issues, alcohol and drug related concerns and help students access services with the their campus counseling office. By calling (209)228-4266,  the Counseling & Psychological Services Center number, you may access this service. A UC Merced professional counselor will follow-up with you the following business day.
