            <p>
            Counseling groups typically meet once per week for anywhere between 6 and 10 weeks, with each session lasting approximately 1.5 hours. Most counseling groups are structured around a particular topic or area of concern (e.g., stress management or body image), although some counseling groups are more process oriented to allow students a greater opportunity to connect, encourage, and support one another. It is necessary for each potential group member to undergo a group screen with the group leader to assure that a particular group is appropriate for you and to adequately prepare you for the group counseling experience. Please stop by or phone Counseling & Psychological Services if you are interested in group counseling.
